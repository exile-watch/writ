  Writ Design System

  Shared components, icons and other UI goodies.

## Description

_Writ Design System_ is based on real-world codebases. 

_Writ Design System_ provides UI components to help contributors work more efficiently, and to make _Writ_ modules more cohesive.

While _Writ Design System_ is not yet accessibility friendly as well as not thoroughly tested, this will be changed in the future.

Aim of the _Writ Design System_ is to provide high quality experience for both, developers and users, that effortlessly scales across _Writ_ modules.

_Writ Design System_ is intended for all platforms and latest browsers. This may not be the case in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase, but it sets a ground up for the future.

### Packages

_[(The Maven's) Writ](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Maven%27s_Writ) there is no [(The Maven's) Crucible](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Maven%27s_Crucible)_

_Similarly, without a [design system](https://github.com/exile-watch/writ) there is no [user facing website](https://github.com/exile-watch/crucible)._
